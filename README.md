# JavaScript-ES6
Modern JavaScript

## Variable Declaration
In ES6 we use let and cons to declare our values
**cons** is for values that we don't want to change
**let** is for values that might want to change or mutate

Variables declared with var in ES5 are function scope but variables declared with let and cons in ES6 are block scope, a block is all the code that is wrapped in curly braces.

These values are only available inside the block. If you call them outside JS will not see them.
