# JavaScript-ES6
Modern JavaScript

## Variable Declaration
In ES6 we use let and cons to declare our values
**cons** is for values that we don't want to change
**let** is for values that might want to change or mutate

Variables declared with var in ES5 are function scope but variables declared with let and cons in ES6 are block scope, a block is all the code that is wrapped in curly braces.

These values are only available inside the block. If you call them outside JS will not see them.
var will be available anywhere

## Blocks and IFFES

Blocks are used in ES& for data privacy. The data goes inside curly braces.

## Strings 
instead of concatenating with +, we use backticks, wrap the string with curly braces and a dollar sing at the beginning. strings.js

## Arrow Functions
An improved way to write functions because it uses less code. The biggest advantage of using arrow functions is that share the surrounding this keyword
